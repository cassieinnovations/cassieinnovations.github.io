<p>Allow me to introduce myself. I am Christina Socias, the other half of Cassie. Stephanie is my sister first and co-founder second. I never planned to have a startup with my sister, we just fell into this together and haven’t looked back since. Anyone who has spoken to me in the past year would think someone named “Cassie” is my sister. Nope! Cassie has been the focal point of our lives now since May 2014. As such, we decided to start this blog to document Cassie’s growth.</p>

<p>This blog is meant to be a complete reveal of the development of our startup. We don’t want to hold anything back because I think anyone who has any interest in starting their own company could benefit from uncensored access into another’s struggle at developing their startup. I use the word struggle because I am not afraid to admit that Cassie’s journey has not been easy. It has been the most exciting and satisfying venture but not easy! As we write this blog, please feel free to give us pointers, tell us what you think we’re doing wrong, and help us make Cassie a true success. Our intent is that in the very near future you, your friends, family, and strangers on the street are forecasting on Cassie right from their phone.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>To a bright future,</p>

<p>CMS</p>

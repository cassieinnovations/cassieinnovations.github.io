Howdy Everyone (and by everyone, I mean the millions of people reading this blog of course)!

Stephanie here. I'm one of the co-founders of Cassie Innovations. My sister Christina and her friend Jimmy are the other two co-founders but since Jimmy is now in med school, it's just Christina and I at the helm. We've been working on Cassie since May 2014 and have come a long way over the past year...but there is much more to come! Our beta version is live at [cassieapp.com][cassieapp] and we have this cool website/blog to tell you about everything we're doing to get Cassie off the ground.

In posts to come, Christina and I will share our story of building this startup. In the meantime, make sure to create an account on Cassie and start forecasting. I've been at the top of our leaderboard for some time so feel free to try and take my spot!

Oh, and if you have any comments or suggestions on how we can make Cassie better, leave a message below or shoot us an email at [teamcassie@cassieapp.com][email].
